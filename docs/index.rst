SerialTalk documentation
========================

This is a library for robust, near real-time communication between two UART devices. We developed it on python 3.9 with LEGO EV3, SPIKE Prime and other MicroPython (ESP/STM32) modules. The library is available on github: `UartRemote on GitHub <https://github.com/antonvh/UartRemote>`_.
The library has the following properties:

* It is fast enough to read sensor data at 30-50Hz.
* It is fully symmetrical, so master and slave can have the same import.
* It includes a RAW REPL mode to upload code to a slave module. This means you can develop code for both modules in one file.
* It is implemented in MicroPython and Arduino/C code. With Arduino code, much higher sensor reading speeds are possible, but flashing is a bit less user friendly.
* The library has a command loop to wait and listen for calls. That loop is customizable and non-blocking so you can add your own code to it.
* The python-struct-like encoding is included in the payload, so the other side always knows how to decode it.
* Compatable with most RS232-TTL 3.3v/5v converter board to further expand i/o possibilities. 
* Remote module importing

Usage: you can use all of the parts of this library for your own projects. Please give us credits at least. We put a lot spare time in this. You are also welcome to contribute. Please fork and PR.



Goal
----

The package aims to facilitate communication between devices
like Robots and peripheral embedded systems or monitors over a serial
communication line. Sounds abstract? Think connecting an OpenMV camera
to a LEGO SPIKE Prime Robot. Or linking up two pyboards.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install it is with the mpy-robot-tools installer.

Usage
-----

When you want default UART for the platform youâ€™re running on, just go:
``from serialtalk.auto import SerialTalk``

When you want special channels like sockets or Bluetooth, do it like
this:

.. code:: python

   from serialtalk import SerialTalk
   from serialtalk.sockets import ClientSocketSerial

   ser = SerialTalk(ClientSocketSerial("127.0.0.1",8080))
   ser.call('echo','read?')

Example with OpenMV H7
----------------------

1. Copy the complete serialtalk directory to the OpenMV flash (not the
   whole repo, just the library)
2. Create a main.py with this code. It is an adaptation of the OpenMV
   Hello world

.. code:: python

   import sensor, image, time
   from serialtalk.auto import SerialTalk

   sensor.reset()                      # Reset and initialize the sensor.
   sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.RGB565) # Set pixel format to RGB565 (or GRAYSCALE)
   sensor.set_framesize(sensor.QVGA)   # Set frame size to QVGA (320x240)
   sensor.skip_frames(time = 2000)     # Wait for settings take effect.
   clock = time.clock()                # Create a clock object to track the FPS.

   st = SerialTalk()                   # Create UART comm object
   def fps():                          # Create function to call from uart
       return clock.fps()
   st.add_command(fps,"repr")          # Add function to callable uart commands

   while(True):
       clock.tick()                    # Update the FPS clock.
       img = sensor.snapshot()         # Take a picture and return the image.
       st.process_uart()               # Process aurt calls
       print(clock.fps())              # Note: OpenMV Cam runs about half as fast when connected
                                       # to the IDE. The FPS should increase once disconnected.

3. On the SPIKE Prime `Install
   mpy-robot-tools <https://github.com/antonvh/mpy-robot-tools/blob/master/Installer/install_mpy_robot_tools.py>`__
   with the installer script. Note that the installer may seem
   unresponsive. Just have some patience.
4. Run this script on SPIKE Prime:

.. code:: python

   from projects.mpy_robot_tools.serialtalk import SerialTalk
   from projects.mpy_robot_tools.mshub import MSHubSerial

   st = SerialTalk(MSHubSerial('F'))

   print(st.call('echo','Hello there OpenMV!'))
   print(st.call('fps'))

This should be the result: Spike result
