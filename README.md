# SerialTalk: platform independent symmetric communication library
## Goal, usages
The goal of the package is to facilitate communication between devices like Robots and peripheral embedded systems or monitors over a serial communication line. Sounds abstract? Think connecting an OpenMV camera to a LEGO SPIKE Prime Robot. Or linking up two pyboards. 

## Roadmap, todo
- create compiled files & installers for SPIKE
- Add example projects
- create tests for pytest
- Create boilerplate code
- test on esp8266 platform
- create bt comm channels
- create pyserial/desktop channels
- create socket serial channels
